# Credit-Scoring-Model

This repository contains a complete machine learning pipeline to predict the probability of credit default using financial and demographic information. The project is built around the Kaggle "Give Me Some Credit" dataset.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a predictive model that estimates the likelihood of a person experiencing financial distress (default) in the next two years. This can be helpful for banks or financial institutions to assess credit risk.

- `Divya_Credit_Scoring_Model.ipynb` â€” Full Jupyter notebook with preprocessing, visualization, model building, and prediction.
- `requirements.txt` â€” List of Python dependencies to reproduce the project.
- `README.md` â€” You're reading it :)

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset includes:
- Demographic info like age, dependents
- Financial metrics such as debt ratio, monthly income, number of credit lines, late payments, etc.
- Target variable: `SeriousDlqin2yrs` (1 = default, 0 = non-default)
